# Notes
## Known Issues

* There appears to be a timing issue with rendering multiple charts.
  * Given the user adds one ticker symbol, then clicks the "Generate Charts" button, when the user repeats this process, then the charts render properly.
  * Given the user adds multiple ticker symbols, when the user clicks the "Generate Charts" button, then some charts may not render and the user will see a blank div with a black border.
