# Notes
## Known Issues

* The charts generated by CanvasJSChart experience seemingly random failures. The component state is being updated correctly, but sometimes one or more charts fail to render.
* API calls to the actual API return an empty object for the data in the response. The correct api-token is being passed and the token seems to work as intended, which explains why the response contains a 200 OK status. Unsure why this is happening.
